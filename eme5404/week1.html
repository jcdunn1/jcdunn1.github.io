  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In this journal entry, I review the changing media ecology of online learning by adopting Discord, a communication platform originally designed for gaming. The research of Lauricella, Kay, and Craig (2023) provides a reflective analysis of the impact of Discord on interaction and communication in two upper-year undergraduate courses, framing it as a powerful medium reshaping the virtual classroom environment.
  </p>

  <h2>Technology and Media Ecology Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    In the framework developed by Islas and Bernal (2016), a media ecology is a complex system of relations bounded by communication technologies, symbols, and social structures. Discord is an excellent example of this in the sense that it creates an informal, always-on communicational space that differs from traditional learning management systems (LMS).
  </p>
  <p>
    Lauricella et al. (2023) found that Discord promoted student engagement in the form of a sense of community, real-time and asynchronous discussion, and an comfortable learning environment. Students particularly enjoyed being able to informally engage with peers and instructors, stay updated with class information, and keep learning outside the classroom.
  </p>
  <p>
    These findings strongly resonate with my own experience at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020. I was teaching <strong>ECE 351: Digital Systems Design</strong> at the University of Tennessee, a core computer engineering course with a small, technologically savvy class of 14 students. When our class abruptly switched to online learning midway through the semester, I had the students vote on the platform to use for synchronous classes. With Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Discord being the options, the resounding choice was <strong>Discord</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A majority of the students were already familiar with Discord from personal use and were actively engaged in a student-run departmental server for both Computer Science and Computer Engineering majors. As the platform was already a part of their social and academic life, the adoption was seamless. Discord soon became not only a method of delivering lectures and answering questions but also a virtual common room for continuous collaboration and bonding.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the highlights came when we combined a shared cultural interest with course content: the entire class gathered inside <strong>Minecraft</strong>, a game they all cherished, and constructed and presented collaboratively Tree Adders, a core topic of that week's lecture. This not only made the abstract concepts of digital logic more concrete but demonstrated the adaptive, immersive quality of an evolved media ecology. The session broke down walls between gaming, education, and art and showed how media tools can be both platform and pedagogy.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Discord breaking into education, particularly during disruption, speaks to its capacity to redefine the media ecology of an educational environment. It is beyond a tool for communication; it is a space that affords symbiosis, adaptability, and interaction on the terms of the learners. My experience reflected what Lauricella et al. (2023) discovered: Discord facilitated a more robust sense of community, encouraged engagement, and offered an informal, low-stakes environment that was inviting to learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Media ecology instructs that technologies are never neutral; they reformulate how we learn, teach, and communicate with one another. Discord offers a compelling case of how a medium originally designed for play has been remade into a legitimate pedagogical environment, especially when it is taken up by communities who already view it as part of their everyday ecosystem.
