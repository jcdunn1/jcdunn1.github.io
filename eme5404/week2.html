  <h1>The Mental Health Impact of Social Media on Youth</h1>
  <p><strong>By Josh Dunn</strong></p>

    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2023). <em>Social media and youth mental health: The U.S. Surgeon General’s advisory</em>. <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The use of social media is almost ubiquitous among adolescents, with about 95% of those aged 13 to 17 reporting that they use some kind of social media, and more than a third reporting their use as "almost constant" (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2023, p. 4). With technological advances in social media ongoing, implications for adolescents' mental health grow more urgent. This journal article discusses the advisory issued by the 2023 U.S. Surgeon General regarding this matter, one that is as much a warning as a call to action about the negative consequences of social media for adolescents' mental health. The advisory is especially pertinent given increasing rates of youth anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts.
  </p>

  <h2>Discussion of the Advisory</h2>
  <p>
    The notification issued by the U.S. Surgeon General is an extensive analysis of adolescents' use of social media and their mental well-being. The advisory recognizes that when used properly, social media holds various benefits, including providing peer support, promoting creativity and expression, as well as making health-related information more accessible. However, the advisory highlights major concerns related to those types of social media that do not include specific design features specifically for adolescents and thus pose serious harm to adolescents' well-being.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Key Risks</h3>
  <p>
    Teenagers are often exposed to content that glorifies unrealistic body image standards, promotes suicide and self-harm, and other negative behaviors. The report indicates that "nearly 64% of adolescents are 'often' or 'sometimes' exposed to hate-based content online" (HHS, 2023, p. 5). This exposure can lead to negative social comparisons, lower self-esteem, and greater dissatisfaction with one’s body, especially in adolescent females.
  </p>
  <p>
    The advisory cites multiple studies linking social media use with poor mental health outcomes, particularly for young users who spend more than three hours per day on platforms. These youth face twice the risk of experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety (HHS, 2023, p. 6). Importantly, this does not suggest causality, but the correlation is strong enough to warrant concern.
  </p>
  <p>
    Social media is heavily used during late-night hours and causes the disruption of sleep and normal activity patterns. The blue emission on electronic displays together with the worry based on fear of missing out (FOMO) and constant alerts contributes to delay in sleep onset and sleep quality deterioration, and indirectly on mood and academic performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Various platforms utilize algorithmic reinforcement systems and gamified interaction mechanics to sustain audience engagement. Features like endless scrolling, the offering of likes, and customized content feeds have the potential to condition users, especially teenagers, to develop addictive habits around checking notifications or online validation. According to the report, “children are more susceptible to addictive behaviors” because of their phase of brain maturity (HHS, 2023, p. 8).
  </p>
  <p>
    The directive states that certain populations bear a disproportionate burden, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Girls, especially those exposed to appearance-related content.</li>
      <li>LGBTQ+ teens can face both support and heightened exposure to online bullying.</li>
      <li>Children who have existing mental health conditions might be more likely to be affected negatively by the platform.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Recommendations for Action</h2>
  <p>
    The recommendations do not place responsibility solely with adolescents and their families; rather, they clearly call for an active involvement of all stakeholders in constructing a safer media environment for young people. Tech firms are urged to design platforms that have youth-friendly features by default, limit exposure to negative material, and enable data-sharing with researchers. Policymakers are encouraged to fund more research, enact safety legislation, and ensure age-appropriate design standards. Parents and guardians are advised to encourage open communication, set boundaries on technology, and model proper behavior. Academics and educators are urged to integrate digital literacy into their curriculum and to advance understanding of the long-term effects of social media.
  </p>

  <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    As an academic working with college undergraduates, I witness ongoing effects of adolescents' use of media that continue throughout their college years. Students often report experiencing exhaustion from constant connectivity, an endless need for social validation and acceptance, and an eroded ability to focus on tasks without constantly checking their electronic devices. These events need not be seen as generational quirks; they mark profound shifts in how our students view themselves and their peers. This observation points to a need to infuse media literacies into mental health instruction and highlights the need to model healthy technology habits through model media behavior among faculty members themselves.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The U.S. Surgeon General's advisory is a timely and well-documented resource, framing social media as both an opportunity and a potential threat to the mental health of youth. Its conclusions align with ideas drawn from media ecology theory, which contends that media are not merely containers for content; they also shape the environment in which human development unfolds. Given the complex and often contradictory consequences that come with social media, the prescription is not the outright elimination of these platforms; instead, it involves their redesign, regulation, and the institution of education to equip users to thoughtfully engage with them.
