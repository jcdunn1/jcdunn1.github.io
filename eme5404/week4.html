  <h1>AI in Education: Value and Limits</h1>

    Bush, S. (2025, June 2). <em>There are some things in teaching that AI won’t change</em>. Financial Times. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1369e4f6-12c7-43ec-b620-4f74e601c8ff" target="_blank">https://www.ft.com/content/1369e4f6-12c7-43ec-b620-4f74e601c8ff</a>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    AI has far-reaching impacts in every aspect of human life, with its impacts in the field of education particularly key. More educators and policymakers are looking into the means to incorporate AI into pedagogy, either as an adjunct to instruction or as a separate subject. In the piece "There are some things in teaching that AI won’t change," Bush (2025) breaks down the projected benefits and limitations linked to AI in contexts related to learning. According to him, while AI can be used to better the efficiency in administration and expand the availability of resources, it cannot replace basic knowledge or the necessity of human understanding.
  </p>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    Bush (2025) equates the debate about artificial intelligence in schooling to long-standing tensions within "skills-based" versus "knowledge-based" curricula. He believes societies tend to be consistently unable to accurately predict the skills which will be important in the long term. Coding, with its former status as an "obsolescence-proof" skill, is reduced now to being partially automated, as fields like geology have experienced similar disruptions despite their previous stabilizing reputations (Bush, 2025).
  </p>
  <p>
    Bush formulates this as the basic assumption to argue that knowledge, which goes beyond skill, allows people to deal with the uncertainty of the future. He compares the debate regarding skills and knowledge to asking "the right mix between ingredients and cake," asserting that neither can be discussed separately from the other (Bush, 2025).
  </p>
  <p>
    The article also emphasizes the value of AI in easing the burden of grading and administrative work, freeing teachers to focus on higher-order instruction. However, Bush (2025) maintains that even to use AI effectively, teachers need deep subject knowledge. Without it, AI tools risk being misapplied or misunderstood. Further, Bush (2025) points out that artificial intelligence's growing complexity will make it harder to understand; therefore, being able to interpret and evaluate its outputs will require a stronger basis of human judgment. A basic understanding of computer systems and coding processes will be essential, though expertise in "coding" per se will have less practical importance.
  </p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    In my experience as a computer science educator, I can relate to Bush’s position. My own experience has shown me that the students who make the greatest use of artificial intelligence tools, such as code generators, tend to have the greatest difficulty understanding the underlying logic to their programming. As such, my pedagogy involves encouraging AI usage alongside challenging conceptual exercises such as the generation of pseudocode, the diagramming of logic flows, and collaborative instruction within student-to-student settings. These methods attempt to base learning in conceptual understanding rather than convenience.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Bush (2025) makes a compelling case that while artificial intelligence can potentially improve many aspects of education, it should not erode the fundamental principles of teaching. Genuine literacy in an age where AI is overwhelming will not come from the skilled application of technology alone, but from the development of critical thinking capacities and the understanding of complex systems. For AI to help education, instead of lowering its standards, it needs to be integrated intentionally into pedagogical models and be grounded in curricula that value knowledge as much as practical application.
